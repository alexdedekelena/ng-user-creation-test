# NgUserCreation

UI elements created with [PrineNG](https://primeng.org/)
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.13.

## Your goal
It’s a code challenge small enough so it can be solved without investing too much time, but complex enough to give us some hints on your thinking process, problem-solving, testing, and software engineering skills.
You must solve the next exercises using Angular (Typescript). Your objective is to demonstrate your ability to develop efficient, readable and maintainable solutions using only Angular and Typescript.
You are completely free to use third-party libraries for application development (functionality or styles) or for Unit Tests.

## What will be evaluated

### Documentation
The right amount of documentation is the one that explains what a project does, how to operate and why certain choices were made. For this test, also write down what’s left to improve and why.

### Web Standards
We believe in writing accessible web pages that conform to the HTML and CSS spec.
Code Architecture
Code should be easy to read and change. Complexity is more often than not necessary, and choosing the right abstraction is vital to keep a healthy codebase.

### Test Coverage
No project can be defined ready for production without a suite of tests that verifies its operating as expected. Our approach is to write code that is easy to test in isolation. This will allow easier composability.

### Design and Responsible
Our approach to design goes back to our belief in an accessible web. It provides a functional user interface, enhanced by thoughtful user experience.

### Extra Mile Bonus (not a requirement)
In addition to the above, time permitting, consider the following suggestions for taking your implementation a step further:
- Application logging and metrics
- CI/CD
- Pattern
- i18n
- Etc.

## Test
The application should allow a customer to:
- Create a new user (username, password, date-expiration and if it’s enabled or not).
- Check the current users that are registered.

## Installation
To install package dependencies, run:

```bash
npm i
```

## Run Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
